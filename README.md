# visual-automation-playwright
An example of visual testing automation with playwright

This example illustrates some E2E/browser visual automation for the https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login page

There are two examples:

- Using the built-in visual comparison tooling within playwright
- Using a 3rd party application, applitools 

The latter will only work for you if you have a free tier applitools account

The benefits of visual testing over a more traditional approach is that there is less need for specific assertions that 
would otherwise be present, although this may vary depending on the nature of the web applications/pages being checked
along with the capabilities of the visual tooling involved. It does in principle have the potential to make E2E testing
code simpler to write and follow.
